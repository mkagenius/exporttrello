# exporttrello

`python export.py`

* You can export all the comments in all the boards, across all the org you have access to.

* Use the key and token provided by trello dev API dashboard.

_To get started, youâ€™ll need an API key. You can get your API key by logging into Trello and visiting https://trello.com/app-key. Be sure to read and agree to Trello Developer Terms of Service. Your API key will be clearly labeled at the top of that page._

_Your API key should be a 32 character string comprised of random alphanumeric characters. Because of the way the authorization flow works, the API key is intended to be publicly accessible. An API key by itself doesn't grant access to a user's Trello data. However, because API tokens grant access to the user's data, they should be kept secret._

* Export is basic but gets the job done. 

* Those chrome extensions and power ups looked little risky so I coded my own version of the export.
